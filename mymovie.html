<pre class="dir"><font color="white">
In his signature black turtleneck and blue jeans, shrouded in shadows below a milky 
apple, Steve Jobs' image was ubiquitous. But who was the man on the stage? What 
accounted for the grief of so many across the world when he died? From Oscar-winning 
director Alex Gibney, 'Steve Jobs: The Man In The Machine' is a critical examination 
of Jobs who was at once revered as an iconoclastic genius and a barbed-tongued 
tyrant. A candid look at Jobs' legacy featuring interviews with a handful of those
close to him at different stages in his life, the film is evocative and nuanced in 
capturing the essence of the Apple legend and his values which shape the culture of 
Silicon Valley to this day.</font></pre>
